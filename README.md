# EfoZol - Open Market - Making Retailer Prices Open
Open Grocery will make retailers produce prices accessible and available to the public. 
The projectâ€™s first goal is to create a tool that allows each user to compare the cost of their personal shopping bag with all big retailers, including the ability to filter based on geo-location. This way, we can all easily know where to do our shopping.

As a second goal, and after collecting the data over time, we wish to publish some analysis of the Israeli market. For instance, we believe we could supply information on topics such as increase or decrease in the price of produce for the manufacturer, identifying food cartels and price fixing, analyzing the food cost with accordance with living area, predicting price changes for certain holidays (Passover, Shavuot, Independence Day etc.) and agricultural events.
